Note About Forward-Looking Statements
This report includes estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results that are âforward-looking statementsâ within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including the following sections: âBusinessâ and âManagementâs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsâ. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words âbelieve,â âproject,â âexpect,â âanticipate,â âestimate,â âintend,â âstrategy,â âfuture,â âopportunity,â âplan,â âmay,â âshould,â âwill,â âwould,â âwill be,â âwill continue,â âwill likely result,â and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. We describe risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially in âRisk Factors,â âManagementâs Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,â and âQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Riskâ in our fiscal year 2024 Form 10-K. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise.
